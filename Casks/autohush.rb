  caveats <<~EOS
    AutoHush is not notarized by Apple; this cask removes the download
    quarantine so it opens normally.

    On first launch, choose your music player (Spotify, Apple Music, VLC,
    Apple Podcasts, TIDAL or a Safari web app), then allow Automation
    (Accessibility for Apple Podcasts, TIDAL and Safari web apps) to control
    it, and System Audio Recording to measure how loud other apps are, when
    macOS asks.
