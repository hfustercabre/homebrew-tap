  caveats <<~EOS
    AutoHush is not notarized by Apple; this cask removes the download
    quarantine so it opens normally.

    On first launch, choose your music player (Spotify or Apple Music), then
    allow Automation (to control it) and System Audio Recording (to measure
    how loud other apps are) when macOS asks.
