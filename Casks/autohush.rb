  caveats <<~EOS
    AutoHush is not notarized by Apple; this cask removes the download
    quarantine so it opens normally.

    On first launch, choose your media player (Spotify, Apple Music, VLC,
    Apple Podcasts, TIDAL, QuickTime Player, a Safari web app, or another
    app checked with Add an App), then allow Automation (Accessibility for
    Apple Podcasts, TIDAL, Safari web apps and added apps) to control it,
    and Audio Recording to measure how loud other apps are, when macOS asks.
