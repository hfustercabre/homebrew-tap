  caveats <<~EOS
    AutoHush is not notarized by Apple; this cask removes the download
    quarantine so it opens normally.

    On first launch, choose your music player (Spotify, Apple Music or TIDAL),
    then allow Automation (Accessibility for TIDAL) to control it, and System
    Audio Recording to measure how loud other apps are, when macOS asks.
